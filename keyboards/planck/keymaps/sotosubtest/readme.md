# The Soto Planck Layout

This attempts to preserve many of the habits I have from using a Kinesis Advantage.
This puts backspace, space, and enter on the thumbs.
It also uses the tap/hold function to get the GUI key on the thumbs as well.

I have defined a symbol and number layer as well as started a navigation layer.

This layout will make the most sense for the future subatomic layout.
I am prototyping the idea on a planck keyboard until that platform is available.

The most unique items in this keymap are:

- a four-key distance between the index finger home locations.  This provides more space for thumb keys without folding the thumb under the hand.
- tap and hold dual use thumb keys to make more efficient use of space.  the space and backspace are also gui keys to create space in the layout.
- tap and hold on the minus one row pinky keys with shift or semicolon or z (i am a dvorak user)
- non-standard placement of slash, backslash, grave, tab, and others since outer pinky column isn't present on this layout.
