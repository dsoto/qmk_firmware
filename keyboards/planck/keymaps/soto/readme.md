# The Soto Planck Layout

This attempts to preserve many of the habits I have from using a Kinesis Advantage.
This puts backspace, space, and enter on the thumbs.
It also uses the tap/hold function to get the GUI key on the thumbs as well.

I have defined a symbol and number layer as well as started a navigation layer.
